Vitória

Vitória is the fourth most populous city in Espírito Santo, with approximately 370,000 inhabitants, according to estimates from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) (2021).

The municipality also boasts breathtaking natural landscapes and incredible beach spots for enjoying the summer, such as Camburi Beach, Castanheiras Beach, and Curva da Jurema.

The Espírito Santo city is surrounded by Vitória Bay and the Santa Maria, Bubu, Marinho, and Aribiri rivers, and its geography includes islands, coves, hillsides, mangroves, and beaches, making tourism in the destination even more special.

Therefore, the city's natural landscapes enchant all who visit, especially tourists who arrive by plane and can marvel at every detail from above. In fact, seven bridges connect Vitória Island to the mainland. Incredible, isn't it?

The capital of Espírito Santo is the center of the state's metropolitan region, which includes six other municipalities: Cariacica, Fundão, Guarapari, Serra, Vila Velha, and Viana.

Vitória's geographic boundaries are: Serra (to the north), Vila Velha (to the south), the Atlantic Ocean (to the east), and Cariacica (to the west).

In summer, temperatures range between 23°C and 30°C, while in winter, they range between 18°C ​​and 26°C. November is the rainiest month. Therefore, if you want to visit during a less rainy season, avoid traveling during this time.

Craftsmanship is of great importance in Espírito Santo, with a variety of products including weaving, ceramics, fibers, braiding, coconut and wood objects, as well as work with shells and seeds. Espírito Santo culture has been influenced primarily by European, Indigenous, and African influences.

In Vitória (ES), the highlight is the creation of clay pots, made using a centuries-old method inherited from the Indigenous peoples of the Goiabeiras region. The production technique has changed little in over 400 years, since they were produced by the tribes of the indigenous peoples.

Annual in the capital of Espírito Santo, this tradition is celebrated with the Festa das Paneleiras (Feast of the Panel Makers), which has taken place in the second half of each year since 1992. The festival features concerts, performances by Congo bands, traditional foods, and the sale of handcrafted items. The public also has the opportunity to visit the Galpão das Paneleiras (Gallery of the Panel Makers).

The artisans are affiliated with the Paneleiras Association, and most of them work in the warehouse, which has 32 booths with countertops, cabinets, and shelves. To make the pots, the makers source clay from the Mulembá Valley, located in the Joana D'Arc neighborhood on Vitória Island.

The bark of the Rhysophora mangle, popularly known as the red mangrove, is extracted from the mangrove forest bordering the Goiabeiras region. The waterproof tannin dye is removed from this bark, which is then used to coat the still-hot pots.

The tradition extends further, precisely because two typical regional dishes are prepared and served in these pots: moqueca and torta capixaba.
